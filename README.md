Hi, I'm David Zirinsky! Thanks for stopping by my profile. Professionally, I specialize in writing code for high-performance applications.

When I'm not working (or sleeping!), I enjoy diving into various development projects, including Android apps. Below are a few links to some of my published projects.

I hope you find them intriguing!
